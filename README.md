Step 1: I hope you knowledge about tailwindCss and you had already finished setup tailwind copy all the css and js file from dist directory. Add those in your project.

Step 2: Now copy code from index.html from just the "drawer copmonent" and paste it in your project where the css and js file are connected

Step 3: Create a button or div tag and add this drawer-btn class from below

```

Step 4: You're almost done. Check the browser and click the html button that you created. If it's working then fine. Else. Please read the Documentation again and check your dev tool.

Step 5: To Close the drawer clicking body area , add "main-content" id in your content area after you button

```
main-content
```
